# This is the first project on The Odin Project's
# Foundations curriculum, "Recipes."

# In creating this project, I have displayed a basic
# understanding on Git methods such a 'git clone,' 
# 'git add,' 'git commit,' and a few others.

# I will review this document later on completion for
# a status update

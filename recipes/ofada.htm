    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ul-list">
        <li class="ul-list-item">2 Cups of Ofada Rice</li>
        <li class="ul-list-item">Water</li>
        <li class="ul-list-item">Salt, to taste</li>

    <h3 class="h3">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="ol-list">
        <li class="ol-list-item">Pick the stones and dirt from the Ofada rice. Do this carefully as Ofada rice is known to be very dirty and full of stones.</li>
        <li class="ol-list-item">Pour the rice into a bowl, wash repeatedly, see how dirty the water looks.</li>
        <li class="ol-list-item">Rinse till the water runs clean.</li>
        <li class="ol-list-item">Now, add 4 Cups of water, allow to cook on low to medium heat for 12 minutes. Do not cover pot throughout!</li>
        <li class="ol-list-item">Take the rice off the heat and rinse out the starch till water runs clean.</li>
        <li class="ol-list-item">Add 1 cup of water and cook till soft. You’ll need to check on it every now and then to prevent burning or sogginess. When it’s soft, take it off the heat and if you end up with liquid after the rice is fully cooked, drain in a colander.</li>
